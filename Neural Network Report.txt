Neural Network Report

Overview of the analysis: 

The nonprofit foundation Aabet Soup wanted a tool to help them select applicants for funding. They need a binary classifer to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by alphabet soup.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? the two original variables in the model that we targeted were classification and Application Type. In the final optimization code however, we used name and classification.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
